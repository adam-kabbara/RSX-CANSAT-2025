## Competition Documention
All deliverables, team logos, and full results from the 2025 CanSat Competition in Monterey, Virginia, USA!

## Sensor Testing
All sensors used on our CanSat are tested separately using an ESP32-WROOM-32D Dev Module microcontroller. This folder contains all related information regarding the tests completed on these sensors including past designs, schematics, pin connections, and code.

## Circuit Design
This folder contains all the KiCad printed circuit board (PCB) designs our team has created. It also includes each PCB's related schematic, layout, and gerber files with associated custom KiCad symbols, footprints, and 3D models.

## Full Sensor Setup
Initial code used to connect all payload sensor electronics together for testing before integration with full software telemetry.
