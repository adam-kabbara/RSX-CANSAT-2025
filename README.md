# RSX-CANSAT-2025
This repository is designed to manage the files made by the CANSAT team under the Robotics for Space eXploration (RSX) design team at the University of Toronto.

## Telemetry
The code in the main branch is tested and confirmed to be working. All untested code must be pushed into the 'beta' branch.

## Sensor Testing
All sensors used on our CANSAT are tested separately using an ESP32 Dev Module microcontroller and those codes are under this folder.
