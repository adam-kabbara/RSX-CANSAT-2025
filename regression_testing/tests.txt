Test commands to be sent from ground station

TODO: Once we have arduino shield, make this into a bash script for sanity regression testing.

* After every correct command expect return of "RECEIVED COMMAND: <command>"

1. Wrong format: expected return = "$W COMMAND REJECTED: FORMAT IS INCORRECT. EXPECTING 'CMD,<TEAM_ID>,<CMD>,<DATA>'"
"HELLO WORLD"
"CMD"
"A,B,C,D"
"CMD , 9999 , CX , ON"
"CMD,9999,CX,ON,DATA"
"CMD9999CXON"

2. Message does not start with 'CMD': expected return = "$W REJECTED INPUT: TEAM ID DOES NOT MATCH."
"ABC,DEF,GHI,JKL"

3. Set TEAM ID
  a. "CMD,XXXX,RESET_TEAM_ID,0420" - expected return = "$I TEAM ID HAS BEEN RESET TO 0420"

4. Wrong TEAM ID: expected return = "$W REJECTED INPUT: TEAM ID DOES NOT MATCH."
"CMD,ABCD,CX,ON"
"CMD,00000000,CX,ON"
"CMD,1234,ST,GPS"

5. CX Command: TODO

6. ST (Set time) Command
  a. UTC, garbage data - expected return = "$E DATA IS NOT VALID. SEND EITHER UTC TIME OR 'GPS'"
    i. "CMD,0420,ST,12345" 
    ii. "CMD,0420,ST,10:10:10:10"
    iii. "CMD, 0420,ST,10:10"
  b. UTC, valid data - expected return = "$I SET TIME TO: <time>"
    i. "CMD,0420,ST,12:10:34"
    ii. "CMD,0420,ST,06:06:32"
  c. TODO: GPS test

7. SIM Command
  a. Garbage - expected return = "$E UNRECOGNIZED SIM COMMAND:"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,XX3EG"
  b. Enable, Activate, Enable, Activate, Disable - expected return = "$I MODE SET: SIM_READY", "$I STARTING SIMULATION MODE...", "$E PAYLOAD IS NOT IN STANDBY MODE", "$E PAYLOAD IS NOT IN STANDBY MODE", "$I ENDING SIMULATION MODE..."
    "CMD,0420,SIM,ENABLE"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,ACTIVATE"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,DISABLE"
  c. Activate - expected return = "$E SIMULATION MODE IS NOT ENABLED"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,ACTIVATE"
  d. Disable - expected return = "$E PAYLOAD IS ON STANDBY"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,DISABLE"
  e. Enable, Enable, Disable - expected return = "$I MODE SET: SIM_READY", "$I MODE IS ALREADY SET TO: SIM_READY", "$I SIMULATION MODE DISABLED."
    "CMD,0420,SIM,ENABLE"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,ENABLE"
    "CMD,0420,SIM,DISABLE"
